TODO / Ideas:

Sender:

- Send a beacon style packet every X packets that contains
critical data
 - data_bytes
 - oti_common
 - oti_scheme

- all packet will contain a bit on the front that type id's it
 - 0 = data ("symbols")
 - 1 = beacon
 - 2 = beacon + data in payload




Receiver:

Our receiver script will need to collect all packets and turn them into a JSON file with a format Critical data + all symbols.

- multi thread? for concurrent communication with the sat and multiple ground users.

- figure out optimal threading and locking mechanism

OTHERS:

ethtool   - turn off UDP checksum   / We wanna collect malformed packets too
