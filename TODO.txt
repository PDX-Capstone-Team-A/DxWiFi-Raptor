TODO / Ideas:

Sender:

- Send a beacon style packet every X packets that contains
critical data
 - data_bytes
 - oti_common
 - oti_scheme

- all packet will contain a bit on the front that type id's it
 - 0 = data ("symbols")
 - 1 = beacon
 - 2 = beacon + data in payload




Receiver:




OTHERS:

ethtool   - turn off UDP checksum   / We wanna collect malformed packets too



Bugs:

possible 32-64 bit error

things to consider:
missing incoming packets in decode call due to lock. fix via deepcopy? no fix via buffer
packet verification/hash -not drop corrupted packets soemhow?
